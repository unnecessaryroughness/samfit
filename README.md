# Sam's Workout (Alexa Skill)

Skill that semi-randomly generates cardio & toning workouts, within certain parameters.

Exercises.yaml defines which exercises are permitted, with min/max reps for each

Weeklyplan.yaml defines which days are cardio, toning, both, or rest days, along with the desired exerises and total number of minutes/reps.

I know this isn't suited for per-user personalisation, but it's a simple skill designed for one single user and one single use-case. It's also not a publicly available Alexa skill, so don't be judgy.
